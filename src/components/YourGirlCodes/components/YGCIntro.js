      YourGirlCodes is my alter-ego and Passion-Project that was
      born whilst looking for my very first job in Hi-Tech. This was
      in 2019.
      A <b>Bible-Writer</b>, with a highlight's
      reel on my Instagram page and named after my GitHub account.{" "}
      When I have days stuck with <b>imposter-syndrome</b>, YourGirlCodes keeps
      me going. <br />And, truthfully, this is who <b>YourGirlCodes</b> is - the
      stronger me. As my alias, I don't ever really doubt her.
